in this repo im going to be very repetitive, most everything will be unfinished,
the goal is to speed run code, not in the sense im going to rush 
but in the sense im going to consitantly repeat the same set of 
tasks over and over again untill after months maybe years of just repeating 
the same fundimental tasks to the point where its muscle memory,
and maybe i will eventually get to the point where i sorta understand what it is
im actually doing,its` not hard to get a grasp on html/css duh but 
js is a beast from my perspective.

typing speed is also a focus, on that same thought vim is way more fun 
than using a mouse so ima try and drill that too. with th 500i motion(?)
the repitition thing is gonna be way easy, and ill prolly do it a bunch 
but the main vim goal is to practice usefull combinations that i honestly 
cant fathom at this point. but i know their out there. 

so what im uploading in this first commit is the brainstorm kinda thing ive been 
doing in the backround while trying to learn stuff, and i didnt initally intend on pushing
but i like the idea of having a log i can look back to, and see the progress.
and i guess a reference so when i need to use that one thing i did one but dont know how 
to search the right phrase to site a souce, i can just look at it literally. in the last context
i used it

figured id spend some time learning how to document stuff, like the programer way.
i dont understand that yet but i see all the supa nerdz always got long 
readmes with all kinda big words and concepts so maybe i learn that too especially if i 
want to move on to bigger more complex projects, which i do.

like that one app idea i had that has to do with everything ive ever done literally ever.

so here i put this unnessicarily long readme that i will never spell check in a million years.
